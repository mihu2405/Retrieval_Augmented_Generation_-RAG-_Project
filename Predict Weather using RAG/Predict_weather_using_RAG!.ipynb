Jena Climate dataset is made up of quantities such as air temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind direction, etc. that were recorded every 10 minutes, over several years.\n","\n","In a tabular dataset like this, every column can be seen as a feature vector identified uniquely by the time stamp associated with them. We can use these vectors to perform similarity search with a given query vector at a certain time to predict the weather for that hour. Though a very simple embedding extraction process, we want to see how far we can get even with a basic similarity search method like this.
